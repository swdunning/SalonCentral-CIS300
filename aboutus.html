            <dt><strong>What is Yurt?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has
                    canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
                </dd>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
                </dd>
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable
                    walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
